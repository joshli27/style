# Style Classification model

# Introduction
We are using a primarily text based approach to solve the problem of style classification for items of clothing. In order to classify the style we must gain more information about each item of clothing from the given data. This has lead to the creation of three models: occasion model, tier model and color model.

# Occasion Model
This model gives us the occasion that an item of clothing is to be used in.

## Input
Product's name and description

## Output
Style: ['Formal', 'Business', 'Casual', 'Athletic']

One product could have multiple styles. 

Ideal model should prevent combinations like ('Formal', 'Casual'), ('Formal', 'Athletic'), ('Business', 'Athletic') from appearing.

# Tier Model
This model provides us the fashion tier of an item of clothing.
Here the brand name and price is used, the brand name is an important feature as for example, no matter the price of a Channel product, the brand itself lends this product the desginer prestige.

## Input 
Product's brand and product's price (normal price is to be used, if unavailable, sale_price is used)

## Output
Tier: ['Fast Fashion', 'Mid level', 'Designer']

## Evaluation
The dense model performs at an accuracy of about 93%
    The model does not recognize fast fashion items well, in the training data there are not many items that are fast fashion, so with fast fashion items in the training set performance could improve
    
    The model predominantly identifies the expensive items as designer however it has trouble with certain brands (Valentino, Tom Ford)
    
    Brands with a wide range of prices are sometimes troublesome, for example Nike's are mostly in the mid tier, however some Nike items from StockX should be designer but are sometimes labelled Mid tier

# Color Model
Using the results from the pre-existing color model, items with more flamboyant and bright colors are classified as loud, more neutral colored items as neutral.

## Input
Product's colors

## Output
Noise: ['Loud','Quiet']

# Other Files
cat_pricest.csv     - the quartile prices for each category of clothing for the data in data_pretrianing.csv
style_map.csv - how each combination maps to a specific style
classify_style.py   - classifies the style for each item of clothing based of its occasion, tier and noise
dictionary_nba1.csv - list of terms that correspond to NBA products
dicitonary_nfl.csv  - list of terms that correspond to NFL products

# Still to be done
The classify_style.py is still unfinished, I attempted to build the vectorization approach but did not finish it.
The output of the predict_tier.py file is currently just a list with no other data apart fro mthe tier, adding this data into one with the item's name, brands, etc. would be useful
In generate_training_data.py iterrows is used, a vectorized approach would be better
Using the NBA and NFL terms to create two seperate styles of clothing could be useful for future classifcations
